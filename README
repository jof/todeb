   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the `example' dir is a todeb.yaml that specifies installing all the
    files under the `contents' directory.

   :; todeb < examples/simple-directory-example/todeb.yaml
   :; sudo dpkg -i todeb-working-dir/todeb-example_0.0.0.deb
   :; sudo dpkg -r todeb-example

    You have installed an removed a simple collection of files.




                      Installing/removing a simple collection of dependencies.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The file `tex_install.yaml' specifies a few TeX packages I regularly use.

   :; todeb < examples/simple-dependencies-example/tex_install.yaml
   :; sudo gdebi todeb-working-dir/my-tex-stuff_0.0.0.deb
   :; sudo aptitude remove my-tex-stuff

    Note that you use `gdebi' on installation to ensure dependencies are
    resolved.

    Depending on what TeX packages you already have installed, maybe nothing
    happened. Any TeX packages installed as dependencies of `my-tex-stuff' are
    removed when `my-tex-stuff' is removed; the other packages are left alone.
